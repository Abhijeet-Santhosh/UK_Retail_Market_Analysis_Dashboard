# UK_Retail_Market_Analysis_Dashboard
There are several supermarket chains existing in the United Kingdom competing with each other by serving a distinct customer segmentation. The situation under study is that the global retailer Carrefour wants to understand the UK retail market in terms of its potential to expand business. A data-driven approach for making a judgement is implemented and initialises the development of an interactive dashboard using the Dash Python framework. With this dashboard, the market share of big retailers, their price distribution, product variety, and economic indices such as the Retail Sales Index (RSI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the country will be analysed.
