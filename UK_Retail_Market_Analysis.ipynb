    "There are several supermarket chains existing in the United Kingdom competing with each other by serving a distinct customer segmentation. The situation under study is that the global retailer Carrefour wants to understand the UK retail market in terms of its potential to expand business. A data-driven approach for making a judgement is implemented and initialises the development of an interactive dashboard using the Dash Python framework. With this dashboard, the market share of big retailers, their price distribution, product variety, and economic indices such as the Retail Sales Index (RSI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the country will be analysed."

    "Aim: This project's main objective is to create and develop an interactive dashboard using Dash to monitor the UK retail market for Carrefour. The insights derived from the dashboard would ultimately enable data-driven strategic planning for market entry and positioning Carrefour based on its competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives : The above aim is fulfilled by the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tMarket Share Analysis: Create a stacked area graph and a pie chart showing the distribution of market shares among the biggest players in the UK retail market to analyse competitors in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tPrice Distribution Analysis: Box and whisker plot to examine price distribution for all products by all brands and their own brands across the top five UK retailers, filtered by product category to understand pricing strategies and market segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tBy Product Category Comparison: A bar graph is going to show the unique products in each category for all brands and their own brands from the five largest UK retail chains. That should give a good insight into the breadth of products and the differentiation by brand. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tRetail Market Performance: For this purpose, line graphs will be designed, depicting trends in the Retail Sales Index (RSI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which are to indicate the overall performance of the retail market over time and present a visual illustration of trends in sales and inflation among different product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Audience: The dashboard is personalised for the Carrefour decision-maker who has the most significant say on market expansions, especially on entering new countries such as the UK. Senior executives such as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), business development managers, and market expansion directors could refer to this to help them make informed strategic decisions. This visualisation contributes to understanding and evaluating the market trend and competitor positioning and pricing strategies to know the competitive landscape and thus opportunities for growth.\n"

    "Key Visualization Principles Implemented\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An essential part of the dashboard was the principles of basic data visuasization applied to the design with the intent of clarity, accessibility, and relevance. These ensured that each of the individual charts effectively communicated its meaning, guaranteeing thait t enabled Carrefour to make smart data-driven decisions.\r\n",
    "One of the first considerations was the ink used. The headings and labels on the dashboardvehas Carrefour's signature blue curor  in order to be consistent with the brand identity. With the incorporation of the brand logo itself, this interface aims to roporhe user engagement (Tufte, 2001). The design has actively reduced the non-data ink to a considerable amount. Background in white allowed charts to stand ;ut, only non-data ink was the headings that had blue backgrosund to give focus to the graphs (Few, 2006).\r\n",
    "The choice of chart types was guided by the principle of selecting the most effective vissalization for the data type. For example, a box and whisker plot was selected to vissalize price distribution across supermarket brands. This chart type is valuable for asalyzing not only the average price but also variability, outliers, and price range, providing insights into the pricing strategies of competitors (Cleveland, 1994). Similarly, stacked area charts and pie charts were chosen to display market share trends and proportions over time, allowing users to easily track changes in the competitive landscape (Heer et al., 2010). Furthermore, the design adhered to user-centricity by ensuring that each chart was designed with the user’s needs in mind. Short explanatory paragraphs were included within each section to provide context, ensuring that users could navigate the data without requiring technical expertise (Shneiderman, 2003).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Stduy was done on choosing the right type of vssualization for the selected data type. A box and whisker plot, for example, is used to represent the distribution of prices among supermarket brands. This sort of chart is very useful insanalyzing not only the averageprice, but also its variation, any ou,tliers and the price range and psrovide valuable insights into pricing strategies and custommentationgefent og competitors (Cleveland, 1994). On the other hand, stacked area charts and pie charts are also considered for displaying market shares in proportions over time in order to tacililate tracking of how competitors have evolved over time (Heer et al., 2010). The dashboard is kept very user-centric by incorporating short textboxes in each section to give contextual information without users having to possess high technical knowledge in order to browse through the data (Shneid rman, \n",

    "Key Steps in the Process\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The first of which was to clearly define the project goals and then critically choose data sources. Carrefour's strategic goals of analysing the UK rktail makrrokenre bolied down into 4 key o,bjectives as mentione,d earlier into market share, product description, and economic indicators like CPI and RSI. Once these were set, the next step was gathering data from reliable sources.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Data for market share was obtained through Kantar, which provided the necessary information on UK supermarket status and was instrumental in producing stunning visualizations of the leading retailers such as Tesco, ,Sainsbury's and Aldi (Kantar, 2022). Price distributions and product count data originated from Kaggle which provided the vital inputs to understand the price strategies as well as the diversity in products across the major supermarkets in the UK. This data was valuabse in analyzing price variations through the box and whisker plots and comparing product counts with bar graphs (Kaggle, 2022). Further, RSI and CPI figures from the Office for National Statistics offered the economic context under which Carrefour judged its retail market performance and inflation over time (Office for National Statistics, 2023). \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To develop the next portion of the dashboard, codina J was done in jupyter notebook, and the first thing was to prepare and clean the data. This includes removing all irrelevant columns and focusing on the key metrics that would be used for analysis. Different sources of data would then have to be concatenated to create a unified dataset. Filtering was applied to ensure only the relevant data would be retrieved for the specific visu,amization i.e. Market share, pricing distribution, and product count by category. The data preprocessing step was important since it was meant to ensure that what went into the dashboard was accurate and actionable insight through which Carrefour could make future strategic decisions. The cleansed dataset was used for constructing the interactive dashboard.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Visualization Layout and Design\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The layout of the dashboard is constructed with a user-centric apa smooth, to provide smooth intuitive experience. Itmwas disided anto Markep Shard Analysis, PricepDistribction aod PboductpCount, awn Brand Prodpct Analysis, ard Perfmrmance in Retail Markets (RSI and CPI) divisions. It has allowed users easy navigation with the dashboard and focus on the most pertinent insight for their decisions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Short explanatory paragraphs talked about each section that made it easier for users to comprehend the visualizations. Thus, Carrefour's decision-makers would not require spending extra time on intricate and complicated data analysis to understand the key inputs (Few, 2006). In the end, the usability part is well taken care of by providing some interactive dropdown menus and sliders that let usess filter or customize their information based on different product categories or periods. In fact, this would allow the dashboard to really suit different strategic needs and focus -oints.\r",

    "\r\n",
    "It has well-thought hierarchica,lization of the layout guiding the user's attention to the most critical insights. The charts were given large space to eathe sily read them, while overall design was clear and simple. It produced the simple yet very basic essentials of best-practice information design (Tufte, 2001), very quickly allowing users to ,gnize key insights and which improves usability for the dashboard as a functional tool for strategic decision-making.\r\n"

    "The analytical methods used in the project of dashboard construction were designed in line with the strategic goals of Carrefour's expansion plans to the UK. Starting with descriptive analysis, which is kept as the basis of the dashboard to provide clear and to-the-point insights from the vast data being used. The stacked area charts and pie charts were chosen as they were suited for analysing market shares due to their ability to flexibly represent proportions and trends over time. For instance, stacked area charts emphasise changes in market shares over the course of time at a single glance, while pie charts illustrate individual market shares at a specific year (Heer et al., 2010). Such visualization enables a quick, seamless evaluation for decision-makers on who represents the main competitors for Carrefour in UK markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative analysis was pivotal for analysing differences in strategic pricing and product offerings between supermarkets. The box and whisker plot—an illustration employed to analyze product price distributions among various retail chains by illustrating the key price metrics. The figure portrays a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum values in addition to possible outliers in the distribution. Besides the spread of prices, central tendencies and price variability are captured in this visualization (McClave et al., 2017). The box and whiskers plot for Carrefour not only reflected the price averages but also the extent of price limits of most products whilst also identifying any kind of pricing phenomenons or outliers. Outliers reflected pricing strategies such as premium pricing or deep discounting, which helped Carrefour to conclude about the competitor behaviour. Analysing competitors pricing for efficient market entry is another plus of the price distribution plots by studying the spread and central tendency of prices for product categories (McClave et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "General consumer behaviour analysis can be done with the use of the time series of the retail sales index (RSI) and consumer price index (CPI). Line graphs are used for this to understand how UK consumers react to seasonal changes and major socio-economic events that have occurred throughout the years (Cleveland, 1993). The division between the categories helps Carrefour to focus on important categories that could yield more benefit. Furthermore, the interactive components like the dropdowns and the sliders of the dashboard allowed stakeholders to further explore these trends dynamically, for example, by analysing by isolating for a particular category or within time ranges.\n"

    "The journey of creation of the dashboard project has been challenging yet rewarding, delivering valuable lessons and scope for growth.

    "A major hurdle in the beginning was the incorporation of a chloropleth map showing the number of supermarkets in locations over the UK. Although a very good addition, this plot had to be discarded as the GeoJSON file holding the mapping details of UK affected the performance of the dashboard to a drastic level. This decision was thus about the equal trade-off between functionalities and user experience in project design. There was also the challenge of processing data volumes associated with the analysis. Processing extensive data volumes from market shares, product prices, and retail trends normally ended with code executions taking too much time. Several optimisation attempts were made, and several columns were disregarded to facilitate the working of the code.\n",

Incorporating principles drawn from Tufte and Few for the aesthetics of the dashbaord was given much focus, as mentioned earlier. There have been lessons from this project. First and foremost, in cases of constraints, one needs to be able to adapt; sometimes that means efficiency over extensivity. Besides that, it is important to try and test subsections individually to discover bottlenecks early. Finally, incorporating the art of story telling, i.e., putting the most important and grasping information in the beginning and unfolding the story. Overall, it has been a worthwhile learning process in that it entails the complexities that come with data-driven decision-making and highlights some serious design considerations while creating such impactful analytics solutions.\n"

    "To summarise, the project has successfully developed an interactive dashboard that enables Carrefour to get comprehensive insights on the UK retail market, focusing on the expansion aspect. This Python Dash framework dashboard is very intuitive to insight metrics like market share, price spread, product assortments, and economic indicators such as the Retail Sales Index (RSI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI); hence, Carrefour's decision-makers can interpret the competition and pricing dynamics in the UK market for informed decisions into the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the dashboard is kept very user-centric. Textual content in the dashboard not only explains what is there in each visualization, but also provides information on how to use and what insights can be derived from each visualization. The dynamic and interactive features like dropdowns and range sliders allow the users to isolate based on categories, years, or even a range of years to make multiple combinations for better analysis. The use of data type centric visualizations like the use of box and whisker plots allows users to visually understand the vast data much better. Ultimately, this project provides Carrefour with the tools to make data-driven, strategic decisions in their expansion efforts while also demonstrating the value of interactive analytics in driving business success.\n"
